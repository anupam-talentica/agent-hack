route_identification_task:
  description: >
    Identify all possible routes across multiple transport modes, including their respective timings.

    Step 1: Identify the Distance and Mode of Transport
    First, determine the distance between {source} and {destination}, and apply the following travel logic:

    If the distance is less than 200 km, recommend bus or train.
    If the distance is between 200 km and 500 km, recommend train or flight.
    If the distance is more than 500 km, recommend flight.
    
    Step 2: Find the Nearest Major Airports for Flight Options
    If flight travel is required, identify all possible major airports within 500 km of {source}. These could include airports in nearby cities, rather than just the closest one.

    If multiple airport options exist, consider the shortest total travel time when recommending flights.
    Ensure that layovers do not exceed 4 hours to minimize waiting time.
    If there is no direct flight, suggest connecting flights with the shortest layovers.
    Step 3: Compile All Possible Routes
    Your response must include all feasible routes using buses, trains, and flights, providing:

    Which bus service is available?
    Which train is available and at what time?
    Which flight is available and at what time?
    Layover durations at each stop?
